            <p>
              Your web site design &amp; development time frame will be determined by key 3 factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The size of your web site</li>
              <li>The amount of graphics and complexity of your web site structure</li>
              <li>Our current client design schedule</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you/we have gathered together all of your website information (text, graphics, etc.) and are ready to begin, we will give you an estimated completion date. In general, for most small web sites upto 10 pages, you can expect delivery within 12-15 days. For larger web sites, the anticipated completion time is provided in the web-development estimate.</p>

                      While all projects will benefit from testing, some projects may not require independent test staff to succeed.

        Which projects may not need independent test staff? The answer depends on the size and context of the project, the risks, the development methodology, the skill and experience of the developers, and other factors. For instance, if the project is a short-term, small, low risk project, with highly experienced programmers utilizing thorough unit testing or test-first development, then test engineers may not be required for the project to succeed.

        In some cases an IT organization may be too small or new to have a testing staff even if the situation calls for it. In these circumstances it may be appropriate to instead use contractors or outsourcing, or adjust the project management and development approach (by switching to more senior developers and agile test-first development, for example). Inexperienced managers sometimes gamble on the success of a project by skipping thorough testing or having programmers do post-development functional testing of their own work, a decidedly high risk gamble.

        For non-trivial-size projects or projects with non-trivial risks, a testing staff is usually necessary. As in any business, the use of personnel with specialized skills enhances an organization's ability to be successful in large, complex, or difficult tasks. It allows for both a) deeper and stronger skills and b) the contribution of differing perspectives. For example, programmers typically have the perspective of 'what are the technical issues in making this functionality work?'. A test engineer typically has the perspective of 'what might go wrong with this functionality, and how can we ensure it meets expectations?'. A technical person who can be highly effective in approaching tasks from both of those perspectives is rare, which is why, sooner or later, organizations bring in test specialists.

            <p>
              There are a large number of programming languages, and your choice will depend greatly on what kind of prior programming experience you have and what kind of software you're interested in producing. In addition, there's a lot more involved in writing good shareware than just writing software. You need to consider marketing plans, software design, registration incentives, press releases and publicity - and more. Finally, the type of computer and operating system you're writing software for will have a great effect on the available tools and languages. The answers to these questions can - and have - filled books.

            <h3>Software Development</h3>
          <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Software development (also known as application development, software design, designing software, software application development, enterprise application development, or platform development) is the development of a software product. </p>
          <p>The term "software development" may be used to refer to the activity of computer programming, which is the process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process.
          </p><p> Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products Software can be developed for a variety of purposes, the three most common being to meet specific needs of a specific client/business (the case with custom software), to meet a perceived need of some set of potential users (the case with commercial and open source software), or for personal use (e.g. a scientist may write software to automate a mundane task).
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
          Embedded software development, that is, the development of embedded software such as used for controlling consumer products, requires the development process to be integrated with the development of the controlled physical product. The need for better quality control of the software development process has given rise to the discipline of software engineering, which aims to apply the systematic approach exemplified in the engineering paradigm to the process of software development. </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Software development methodology</h4>
          <p>
          A software development methodology is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the process of developing information systems. A wide variety of such frameworks have evolved over the years, each with its own recognized strengths and weaknesses. One system development methodology is not necessarily suitable for use by all projects. Each of the available methodologies is best suited to specific kinds of projects, based on various technical, organizational, project and team considerations.</p>

           <h4>Visual Design</h4>
           Visual design, also commonly known as graphic design, communication design, or visual communication, represents the aesthetics or look-and-feel of the front end of any User Interface. Graphic treatment of interface elements is often perceived as the visual design. The purpose of visual design is to use visual elements like colors, images, and symbols to convey a message to its audience. Fundamentals of Gestalt psychology and Visual Perception give a cognitive perspective on how to create effective visual communication.Information Architecture
           <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
           Information architecture is the art and science of structuring and organizing the information in products and services, supporting usability and findability. More basic concepts that are attached with information architecture are described below.
           <h4>Information</h4>
           In the context of information architecture, information is separate from knowledge and data, but lies indefinitely in the middle. It is information of all shapes and sizes: websites, documents, software applications, images, and more. It is also concerned with metadata: terms used to describe and represent content objects such as documents, people, process, and organizations.
           <h4>Structuring, Organization and Labeling</h4>
           Structuring is reducing information to its basic building units and then relating them to each other. Organization involves grouping these units in a distinctive and meaningful manner. Labeling means using appropriate wording to support easy navigation and findability.

           <h4>
           Interaction Design
           </h4>
           <p>
           There are many key factors to understanding Interaction Design and how it can enable a pleasurable end User Experience. It is well recognizedclarification needed] that building great user experience requires Interaction Design to play a pivotal role in helping define what works best for the users. High demand for improved user experiences and strong focus on the end-users have made Interaction Designers critical in conceptualizing design that matches user expectations and standards of latest UI patterns and components. While working, Interaction Designers take several things in consideration. A few of them are:</p>
           <ul>
           <li>Create the layout of the interface</li>
           <li>Define Interaction patterns best suited in the context</li>
           <li>Incorporate user needs collected during User Research, into the designs</li>
           <li>Features and Information that are important to the user</li>
           <li>Interface behavior like drag-drop, selections, mouse over actions, and so on</li>
           <li>Effectively communicate strengths of the system</li>
           <li>Make the interface intuitive by building affordances</li>
           <li>Maintain consistency throughout the system</li>
           </ul>
           <p>
           In the last few years, the role of interaction designer has shifted from being just focused on specifying UI components and communicating them to the engineers to a situation now where designers have more freedom to design contextual interfaces which are based on helping meet the user needs.</p>

              <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
            <p>
            Quality assurance (QA) refers to administrative and procedural activities implemented in a quality system so that requirements and goals for a product, service or activity will be fulfilled. It is the systematic measurement, comparison with a standard, monitoring of processes and an associated feedback loop that confers error prevention. This can be contrasted with quality control, which is focused on process outputs.
            </p>
            <p>
            Two principles included in QA are: "Fit for purpose", the product should be suitable for the intended purpose; and "Right first time", mistakes should be eliminated. QA includes management of the quality of raw materials, assemblies, products and components, services related to production, and management, production and inspection processes.[citation needed]
            </p>
            <p>
            Suitable quality is determined by product users, clients or customers, not by society in general. It is not related to cost, and adjectives or descriptors such as "high" and "poor" are not applicable. For example, a low priced product may be viewed as having high quality because it is disposable, where another may be viewed as having poor quality because it is not disposable.</p>
